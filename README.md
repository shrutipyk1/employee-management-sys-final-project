# Employee Payroll Data Processing System

I've developed a menu-driven interactive console application for employee payroll data processing. This robust system handles both master and transaction data effortlessly, ensuring streamlined management of employee records and payroll calculations.

Key Features:
📋 Master Data Management: Includes comprehensive employee personal information and customizable payment details like perks, allowances, and incentives tailored to different employee types.
📅 Transaction Data: Tracks monthly attendance data, excluding leaves, to accurately calculate payroll.

Functionality Highlights:
🔍 Search: Easily find any employee's master record along with detailed attendance information.
✏️ Update: Seamlessly update employee master data or attendance records as needed.
🗑️ Delete: Remove unnecessary master or attendance records with simple commands.
📊 Sorting: Display all employee records sorted by payment amount in descending order.
